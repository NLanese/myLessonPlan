INTRO: 

Hello and welcome to the wonderful (sometimes absolutely horrible) world of Coding!

First thing is first: DO NOT WORRY if things do not make sense to you right away. Computer Science requires a very unique style of thinking, and it can take a long time to re-teach the brain how to approach problems. Also, most times Computer Science is pretty hands on, things might not click until you get in there yourself and start coding. It might not even make sense the first couple of times you code, but it will come, I promise. 

We are going to start coding with RUBY. This is just one of many different programming languages. Other include...
    - Java
    - JavaScript (yes, they're different)
    - C
    - Python

Ruby is one of the more user friendly languages, it is intuitive and user-friendly... as far as programming languages go. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART ONE: How do I even Begin to Code?

That's a trick question; you don't. It's important to first understand different concepts of computer science. Think of it like this: Computers can speak Ruby, but they don't understand plain English. You need to learn a whole new language to communicate, but this language does not use nouns, verbs, subjects, predicates, or any other conventional form of speech. You need to first learn how to structure a "computer language" like Ruby. 

Long story short (still not very short) Computer Science / Programing has no *RIGHT* way to code, yet there are certain styles of coding (ways developers organize their data, how they move things around, you'll see more later) that are commonly practiced, all with benefits and downsides. The way I will be focusing on is Object Oriented (yeah, write that down) Programming, referred to as OOP. This style of code focuses on (write this too) recreating real-life objects and assigning them numeric or quantifiable values in order to have them react with different simulated objects.

Whoa, what?

Let me give you an example... 
Let's pretend you're already a super savy kickass developer. Go you. Someone hires you to make a program that can store all of the students' data at a University. The easiest way (and in my humble opinion the most efficient) to do this is by creating STUDENT OBJECTS with values like "graduation_year" or "gpa" assigned to them 

Still not making sense? 
Don't worry-- really, a lot of this is going to be painfully hard to actually conceptualize until you get to work coding. Hop over to the file "code-along.rb" and read from the top. Come back here when instructed to. Or don't, I'm not your legal guardian. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART TWO: The Objects in Object Orientation

The Computer is pretty stupid. Like, really stupid. You need to be painfully specific when communicating information with a computer (which is all coding really is). Computers really only understand a few things...
    1. Simple Math
        A computer will understand any of the core mathematical operations like addition(+), subtraction(-), mulitplication(*) and division(/)
        A computer can also understand comparisons, such as greater than (>), less than (<), is equal to (==), and is NOT equal to (!=)
    2. Code creating or Using an Object / Function
        There are keywords and proper syntax (which is fancy-talk for how I structure the code in terms of what words and punctuation go where) to create and use Objects. Often times, if a computer sees a regular english word (or any language thats not computer-y) it will assume this is a variable
    3. Keywords and other Exceptions
        There are, of course, exceptions but thesre are really complicated and something you do not need to worry about yet. 
We just learned about VARIABLES, and they are just the tip of the IceBerg. The proper syntax (please get used to this word) is as follows...
    -------------------------------------------------------------
        <variable_name> = <value>
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Considering this, the following would be true
  
        `x = 5`      
        the variable x is equal to 5
        `y = x + 6`
        the variable y is equal to x, which is 5, plus 6. Thus, y is 11
        `z = "HaHa! I'm words!"`
       the variable z is equal to "Haha! I'm words!"  
  

Okay... I've used Variables, but what about other Objects? What about functions?
Remember the language comparison from before? How coding is just like speaking another language? Well, imagine it like this...
    If Objects hold information and represent something, they must be like a noun
In that case, FUNCTIONS are like our verbs. These will be how we can change objects or extract data from them, which is the core concept of developing. 
At this point, return tp code-along.rb and return back when it tells you to again. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART THREE: Conclusion

If all of this is still confusing, DON'T WORRY. It's just extremely important to be taking good notes.
Unfortunately, the basics of computer science are like puzzle pieces, none of it really makes sense until
you put it all together, and I can only teach you one lesson-- give you one piece-- at a time. 
In the next lesson we're going to learn how to make a function ourselves, as well as explore some of
the benefits and importances of variables.
